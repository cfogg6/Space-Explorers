SPACE EXPLORERS

It's the year 2110 and Elon Musk has successfully allowed man to live in space. With our futuristically wasteful technology, we have already soiled every inhabitable planet in our solar system. You have been sent on a mission to find the next home for humanity to ruin!... I mean inhabit!

OH NO! Asteriods incoming! Even being near an asteriod will cause your ship to blow up, so you'd better be a good pilot, and trigger-happy too. Dodge and shoot your way through the asteriods as long as you can and maybe (no you won't) you'll make it out alive. Good luck!

tl;dr: stay alive as long as possible

Controls: z to shoot, arrows to move

Rules: Can only shoot once per second, asteriods increase in frequency as more time passes, asteriods vary in speed and size.
